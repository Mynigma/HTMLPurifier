/*
 * HTML Purifier is an HTML filter that will take an arbitrary snippet of
 * HTML and rigorously test, validate and filter it into a version that
 * is safe for output onto webpages. It achieves this by:
 *
 *  -# Lexing (parsing into tokens) the document,
 *  -# Executing various strategies on the tokens:
 *      -# Removing all elements not in the whitelist,
 *      -# Making the tokens well-formed,
 *      -# Fixing the nesting of the nodes, and
 *      -# Validating attributes of the nodes; and
 *  -# Generating HTML from the purified tokens.
 *
 * However, most users will only need to interface with the HTMLPurifier
 * and HTMLPurifier_Config.
